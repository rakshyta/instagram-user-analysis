# Instagram User Analysis

**Project Description:**

The project aims to perform user analytics on the Instagram database. The goal is to provide insights and answer specific questions related to marketing campaigns, user engagement, and investor metrics. By analysing the database, I will identify the oldest users, inactive users, contest winners, popular hashtags, and optimal days for launching ad campaigns. Additionally, I will assess user engagement and identify potential bots or fake accounts on the platform.

**Approach:**

To analyse the Instagram database, I will use SQL queries to retrieve the required information. I will write queries to identify the oldest users, inactive users, contest winners, popular hashtags, and optimal days for ad campaigns. I will also calculate user engagement metrics and identify potential bot accounts. By executing these queries on the database, we will obtain the necessary insights.

**Tech-Stack Used:**

For this project, I will utilize a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL Workbench to execute SQL queries.
